       <p>This is a comic heavily inspired by the Japanese fairytale, <em>Momotaro</em>. 
          While the basic plot points of the original story have been preserved, I've expanded on the characters and the world they inhabit.
          Momotaro was the first story I ever read fully in Japanese, and this project is the longest running comic I've ever worked on. I hope you enjoy.
